# Technician Routing and Scheduling Problem

## Objective and Prerequisites

In this Jupyter Notebook, you will learn how to formulate a multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows 
constraints using the Gurobi Python API. To fully understand the content of this notebook, the reader should be 
familiar with object-oriented-programming.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with the 
Gurobi Python API. In addition, you have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.
### NOTE
``` import xlrd
xlrd.xlsx.ensure_elementtree_imported(False, None)
xlrd.xlsx.Element_has_iter = True
 ```
use this while importing the libraries and also install a old version of xlrd for the smooth functioning of the notebook.
